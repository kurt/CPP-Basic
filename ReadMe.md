**Basic Usage**

Each script has a comment at the top which shows the intended run operation. SOme header files are for some source files. 

**Scripts  and what they do:**

- boost_testing_stuff.cpp:
- virtual_functions.cpp: shows virtual functions and how they work in subclasses
- call_namespace.cpp: calls the namespace that is defined in namespaces.cpp through including namespace.h
- constructors.cpp: this shows how a constructor is called and how functions can be called when an entity is created if included in the constructor.
